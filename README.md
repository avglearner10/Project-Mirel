🌿 Project Mirel – Offline AI Survival Companion

"In a real survival situation where internet access is impossible, Mirel is meant to be your calm, intelligent companion — ready to assist with knowledge, support, and clarity."

💡 About the Project
Mirel is an offline AI-powered survival assistant built to help people when they're truly on their own — in forests, mountains, natural disasters, or even during total communication blackouts.
As a complete beginner in AI and web development, I created this project as a personal challenge and a vision-driven experiment: Can we create an AI that actually helps people in life-or-death situations, even without internet?
With limited time and knowledge, I focused on building the foundation: a working offline AI assistant that runs locally and answers survival-related questions.

🔥 Key Highlights

🧠 Offline AI Agent
Powered by Ollama running llama3.2:1b, Mirel can answer survival questions completely offline.

🗺️ Offline Map Support (WIP)
A tile-based map engine is set up using .mbtiles files, but visual rendering is still under progress.


🎯 My Vision
Mirel is designed to evolve into a full-fledged survival companion. Imagine being lost or hurt in a forest, and having an AI calmly guide you:

How to clean and stitch a wound 🩹

What wild plants are safe to eat 🌿

How to purify water 💧

How to build shelter 🏕

First aid instructions in simple language

Guided steps for calming panic or anxiety

Voice interaction for hands-free help

Logging your journey or symptoms in a survival journal

Star navigation and offline maps

Calorie estimates from found food

I want Mirel to be the AI we can count on — not in the future, but in the wild, when we need it most.

🚧 What's Done
✅ Offline AI Assistant

✅ Flask Web UI

🔄 Offline Map System (currently under debugging)

🙏 Final Note

This project was built from scratch as a learning journey — not everything works perfectly yet, but the goal was always clear:
To create an AI that could potentially save lives — even when the internet can't.
